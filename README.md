# ITLAB CTF GAME
This project was created as part of a Capture the Flag competition organized by the ITLAB club. The development of the game took approximately 24 hours on average. It was designed by me using Godot, a cross-platform game engine. The game features 8 different levels. In each level, you need a total of 7 points to advance to the next level. If you reach the end of a level, press "p" to proceed to the next one. The game's physics are complex to manage, adding an extra layer of difficulty. There are also 2 bonus flags within the game. Good luck to everyone!
